                    <b>Pros</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversification of Revenue: By introducing subscription-based monetization, Twitter aims to
                        reduce reliance on advertising, offering a more stable and predictable income stream</li>
                    <li>Enhanced User Engagement: Subscription models often lead to increased user engagement, as
                        subscribers invest financially in the platform, encouraging deeper interaction.
                    </li>
                    <li>Improved User Experience: Freed from the constraints of advertiser demands, Twitter can focus on
                        delivering a more user centered design, prioritizing subscriber needs.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>User Adoption Challenge: Convincing users to pay for previously free features remains a
                        challenge, as the perceived value of the subscription must outweigh the accustomed free
                        experience.</li>
                    <li>Pricing Dilemma: Striking the right balance in pricing is crucial—competitive yet generating
                        sufficient revenue for sustainability.

                    </li>
                    <li>Continuous Value Maintenance: To retain subscribers, Twitter must consistently innovate and
                        introduce new features, preventing user drop-off.
