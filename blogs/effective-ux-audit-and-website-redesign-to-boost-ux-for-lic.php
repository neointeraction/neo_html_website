                    Life Insurance of Corporation is a government-owned insurance firm in India. It is the largest insurance firm in the region, having a vast number of policyholders and agents. With many businesses going online, websites have become a big deal for all large corporations. And unfortunately, the current LIC website design appears to be out of date. The primary goal of the website is to provide a one-stop online solution to policyholders and insurance advisors, But the site's biggest flaw is the lack of a good user experience.

                    Identified Problems

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    After reviewing their present website design, we discovered a number of issues with the design language (UI) as well as the content's organizational flow (UX). The first step was to make a list of all the problems for our UX Case study.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Integrating machine learning into UI UX design enables product design agenciesto create user centric interactions, making applications more effective and engaging.

                    <b>User Interview</b><br />
                    User interviews are beneficial since they help you understand what design aspects may be improved. We started our user research by conducting interviews with some users which vary from daily active users to infrequent users of the website. The challenges and hardcore things individuals face when using the web are the cornerstones of the questionnaires.
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is your initial impression of the homepage of the LIC website?</li>

                    Usability testing is the process of evaluating how easy a design is to use on a set of users who are representative of the target audience. We at Neointeraction design, analyzed, and addressed user challenges in using the site, such as locating critical features, inconsistency in key element arrangements, unorganized layouts, ineffective navigation bars, and so on. As a result, we planned to,

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Since the LIC website has a vast number of users, it should have simple navigation and information architecture to help people find the services they require.

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Conclusion</h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    UX Audit is a necessary aspect of the design process in order to create a solution that meets both business and user requirements. If we focus on the details of the product and services, we tend to overlook the users and their perspectives. UX strategy and research play an important role in the process of product design. The most important factor of this project was that users might easily be lost due to a bad online presence experience.
