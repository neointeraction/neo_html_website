                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    User Interface design patterns are repeating solutions to prevalent challenges in design. Designers can communicate using design patterns as a shared language. They allow for discussion of alternatives, where simply mentioning the name of a design pattern has far more weight than just the name.

                    <b>Card-style Web Layout design patterns</b>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Cards are important in UI layout design because they blend text and pictures and are particularly beneficial when you want a user to peruse the content of various types and lengths.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    When full-screen items are separated into two or more vertical pieces, a split-screen layout design is used. Regardless of how popular such website themes are these days, this selection can make or break your design. Split-screen layout designs, when done correctly and logically, provide a fantastic viewing experience for your customers. Split-screen layout designs are ideal for minimalist website designs that aren't overburdened with bold UI components. Furthermore, it would be an excellent choice for landing pages with selectable options on both sides.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    The utilization of the  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/ui-ux-design-setting-up-grids-d8b3fd9271fb" target="_blank">grid</a> is attractive to the eye from a mathematical standpoint. Although the grids are not apparent in the UI UX design, they help with element placement, proportional distribution, and interface consistency.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Users are immersed in a straightforward linear experience on single-page sites. There is a distinct beginning, middle, and end to the story. Single-page sites are highly suited for mobile users who are familiar with the scrolling gesture due to their scrolling nature. For sites with a single purpose, one-page navigation is, of course, more straightforward than a larger site.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Asymmetry</b>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Asymmetrical layout designs convey a sense of movement and dynamism. Due to the laws of composition and balance, asymmetry tends to be more expressive to the eye; it promotes the hierarchy of the pieces and gives them movement.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Navigation Tabs</b>

                </div>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Navigation tabs, which resembled tabs on file folders or binder dividers, were formerly a cornerstone of skeuomorphic design. Tab-style navigation, on the other hand, has evolved through time and no longer resembles an actual tab. Instead, each item in a menu has a visual distinction from other menu items, which is a trademark of navigation tabs. This can be inconspicuous at times, and it can also appear just when a menu item is selected or hovered over. Smaller menus with only a few items are best served by navigation tabs. If not, they may appear cluttered. They can, however, be paired with submenu dropdowns to increase their functionality and usability. They're also common in horizontal navigation, however, there are also some ui design pattern examples for vertical navigation.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Carousels of content are frequently found in a website's header or hero section. They frequently incorporate both images and text, while others may just include one or the other. When space is limited, they're utilized to display many content UI components within a single part of a page.
