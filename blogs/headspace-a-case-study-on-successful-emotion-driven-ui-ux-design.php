By addressing users' emotional needs and responses intentionally, designers aim to create more engaging, meaningful, and memorable experiences. This approach focuses on building connections and understanding users by considering their emotions. Let’s dive into the intricate world of emotion-driven UI UX design, focusing on the renowned meditation and mindfulness platform, Headspace.
