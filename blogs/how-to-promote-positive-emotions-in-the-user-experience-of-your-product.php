                    A user scenario is a technique used by designers to comprehend the product for user story mapping.

                        <li>A user scenario should be created before proceeding with a product's general or actual design.</li>
                        <li>Many process facts are revisited throughout scenario development. User Scenario examples are similar to telling someone a tale and then reviewing the key details again.</li>

                        <li>A designer could provide a more accurate estimate of the project scale and difficulty as well as the time required to perform various activities since the user scenario clearly describes what a typical user wants to achieve and what kind of expectations he or she has from the product.</li>
                        <li>User scenario examples will assist us in obtaining the precise journey or mind-map of the product, which will enhance the designer's workflow.</li>

                    As Don Norman, notable cognitive scientist and best known for his popular book ‘The Design of Everyday Things’, had stated in his popular paper on <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design" target="_blank">emotion and design</a>:<br/>
                    “Negative affect can make it harder to do even easy tasks: positive affect can make it easier to do difficult tasks”<br/>
                    It is easy to design when everything is flawless and appealing, but clients struggle with this since they encounter entirely different states. As designers, we must focus on the other states, including the missing data state, the error state, and the blank state.

                    The "blank state" should essentially be the screen's appearance when there is no content, when a new user registers, or when a user views it for the first time. It is the scenario that occurs with a new product or a service when there is nothing to show.<br />
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let's take Instagram as an example. As you are all aware, Instagram is arguably the most well-known and appreciated social media platform that allows us to engage digitally with our friends.</li>

                When it comes to errors, there are two displays 404 errors and the internet connection is lost. The most frequent screen we see today is the 404 error, this state describes what the screen looks like when the user encounters a system error. There could also be an error caused by the user or caused by the system, such as a loss of an internet connection, so there are some considerations we need to make.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Good UI UX Design can help us increase customer satisfaction, and encourage product engagement. <a href="<?php echo $path; ?>blogs/how-a-ux-design-partner-can-benefit-your-company" target="_blank">Why does your Business need Good UX Design?</a> Good UX design means thinking like a user and offering a clear path to assist the user in achieving their goals when interacting with the product.

                </p>

                        <li>When designing a UX, these negative feelings and first-time scenarios are often disregarded, but if done properly, they will contribute to an engaging UX, and as a result, customers are less likely to switch to competing products thus generating positive emotions for the user.</li>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    It's easy to overlook the states in a UX design because they occur frequently and aren't always known well understood, however, the benefits of these inclusions are understated because they enhance user experience.
