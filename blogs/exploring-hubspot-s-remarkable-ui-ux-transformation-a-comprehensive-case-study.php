                <b>User Feedback</b><br>
                HubSpot welcomed user feedback with a positive attitude, acknowledging existing confusion in user flows. Despite the critique being direct, the company actively sought ways to improve the user experience, setting the stage for positive changes.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                <b>Improving User Experience</b><br>
                HubSpot took steps to enhance user interaction by introducing a user-friendly "get-started" flow with free demos and streamlining critical pages from 70 to 39. Initial attempts to incorporate illustrations were dropped after testing indicated a lack of resonance with the brand.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                <b>Design Experimentation</b><br>
                In their quest for an optimal design, HubSpot experimented with over 12 illustration styles, eventually realizing that clear and straightforward designs outperformed fancier options. This iterative design process involved extensive testing, including over 100 wireframe iterations and 60 visual designs.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                <b>User-Centric Approach</b><br>
                HubSpot consistently emphasized a user-centric approach, actively incorporating user perspectives throughout the design journey. This ensured that feedback and testing outcomes guided design refinements before moving on to the development phase.

                </div>
                HubSpot's research highlighted that over 50% of users prefer learning through videos. This insight led to strategically placing video calls-to-action after the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch, resulting in a notable 300% increase in conversions. Aligning design with user preferences played a pivotal role in this success.

                Once all changes were agreed upon, development commenced, incorporating updated conversion flows, new flows, content improvements, and adherence to a global style guide. The result was an optimal live website that significantly outperformed the previous user experience. Hubspot’s post-launch data showcased impressive outcomes:
