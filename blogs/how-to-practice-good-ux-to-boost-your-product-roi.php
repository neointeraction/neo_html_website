                    <b>a. Conduct User Research</b><br/>
                    Designing a product starts with collecting data. While developing a product, it is very important to understand what problem we are trying to solve and for who. Designers can construct flows and designs that feel familiar to that specific user base based on this information. And, when done correctly, it will lead to customer satisfaction while also providing a gratifying experience.

                    It is critical to examine the feasibility and usefulness before designing a product and releasing it. Building wireframes or prototypes is the quickest approach to ensure this.

As a result, a more efficient design approach is prioritized when designing a product.

                    Continuing on from the previous point, the wireframes or prototypes that are created can be shared with a small group of people. And you'll know what's working well and what isn't based on their comments, whether positive or negative. With these suggestions, the design can be tweaked and improved within the process of product design before the introduction of the new product.

To avoid negative experiences for the user UX research plays an important role. User experience is interlinked with brand loyalty. And every experience that has been crafted should be done consciously after all restarting the process of product design would come with a cost.
