                    It is good to follow industry standards and best practices from product designing companies as it helps to keep consistency in functionalities, meets user expectations, reduces the learning curve, and also helps in maintaining consistency in the later stages of UI development using various frameworks or libraries such as react js, angular, flutter, vue, bootstrap, etc. Learn more about how the adoption of the React, Nextjs, and Strapi frameworks improved the Neointeraction Design website's page loading time and traffic <a href="">here</a>.</br>
                    This will also prevent confusion about the names and functionalities of elements. It will also help us convince clients of how certain functionalities behave or how users might use their product.

                    Research data points are more helpful in design discussions because it provides you the information and general implications on how the entire UI UX scope of the design is perceived from the user’s perspective.

                    Quantitative research is nothing but the data filled with numbers that deal with it in a statistical format, which will help us solve the design problem, whereas qualitative research provides raw facts about the data in the form of wording or verbal data, which will help us understand human behavior.

                    Every time a client proposes a UI design concept, we as designers need to evaluate it and determine whether it will make the user's life easier or not. We shouldn't just accept the client's recommendation at face value. Therefore, it is crucial to defend what is right and act in a beneficial way for the user by following the set of UX UI Design Principles that allow the client to decide on the user’s needs.
