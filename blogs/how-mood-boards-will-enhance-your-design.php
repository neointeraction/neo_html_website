                    Moodboard is a collection of visually represented ideas that improve a designer’s workflow and
                    enhance communication. It also minimizes the risks of the client’s rejection of the concept and
                    saves the designer’s time and nerves.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    The use of mood boards is not limited to just one particular field. Creative professionals like UI
                    designers, Fashion designers, interior designers, Photographers, and many more use it to build a
                    visual framework to generate better ideas. Mood boards are meant to showcase the right mood and
                    bring the emotions expected from a product. It is also helpful in effectively collaborating with
                    clients and team members.

                    Purpose of mood boards
                </h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Establishes a strong foundation</b> - Mood board design establishes a visual representation
                        of what the result could look like.</li>
                    <li><b>Helps to refine ideas</b> - Mood board is the beginning of the design process of a product
                        where you explore your imagination and try to find clarity before actually getting into the
                        process.</li>
                    <li><b>Communicates ideas to others</b> - Mere words can’t explain a design idea to a client. To
                        help them visualize, you need a mood board. More information on how to improve client
                        communication can be found <a href="https://www.neointeraction.com/blogs/effective-communication-with-clients-and-5-ways-to-improve-it" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                    <li><b>Organizes the inspiration around a project</b> - One doesn’t put much thought when
                        brainstorming and collecting inspiration. Although, when it comes to presentation, the mood
                        board should be well organized and tell a cohesive story.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">How to create a mood board?</h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    There is no "One Size Fits All" to creating a mood board meaning that there are different formats
                    and styles. Cohesiveness sets the theme of the mood board as well as the final design based on it.
                    For example, a construction company website might have imagery of buildings, and abstract
                    architectural themes and colors would be well matched.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Know about the project or visual design problem</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Understanding your audience is essential when creating a mood board so that your audience relates to
                    your brand values and products. It is critical to select the proper color for your brand in order to
                    attract customers.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Set up the tone for the project</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Ask questions and make a list of keywords that emits the emotion of the project so that you’ll have
                    a clear idea.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Gather resources based on the project idea</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    In this phase, try to collect relevant images and elements based on the questions asked in the
                    previous step. Focus on making a collection of relatable visual representations.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Most designers rush online for mood board examples and inspiration, and Google surely has a vast
                    collection of eye-catchy images but do not limit yourself to one source. Go beyond the digital
                    media, and take inspiration from the outside world.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Collaborate with the design team to get more ideas from different perspectives</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Before collaborating with the UI UX design team, you’d need to organize your images and elements
                    accordingly. Also, this is a good chance to filter out some of those images that you might not like
                    or look a little out of the theme.<br />
                    You can take the help of google slides to organize your ideas, all you have to do is drag and drop
                    all the images and arrange them according to the story you want to tell. Then you can ask your UI UX
                    design team to come and give feedback on the mood board.

                    Taking many opinions always extends one’s perspective and opens the door to more creativity and
                    ideas. One needs as much feedback as possible to understand whether the mood board aligns with the
                    brief and is easily understandable by everyone.

                    There are no rules for creating a mood board. Try to only pick the most relevant images or elements
                    that speak your mind. Designers get a chance to have creative freedom during this phase which also
                    helps to give direction to the project. For assistance in creating mood boards or for any other UI
