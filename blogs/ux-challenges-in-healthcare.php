                <div class="blog-banner-img">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Many businesses, particularly IT corporations, have had a significant impact on their success due to design. However, the design does not yet have a seat at the table in several industries. One of them is healthcare design.</p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">New challenges in the healthcare industry accelerate the growth of healthcare development of healthcare innovation. Their user interfaces are usually outdated and cluttered. According to The <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/sites/default/files/2017-01/delivering-the-benefits-of-digital-technology-web-final.pdf" target="_blank">Nuffield research</a>, there are at least 10 years of distance between healthcare and other industries in digitizing the healthcare processes. Their user experience is perplexing and overpowering. This UI UX Design is more than just looking "old." Rather, when compared to other businesses, healthcare software solutions give less value and effectiveness to their key clients.</p>
                <div class="blog-quote-block">
                    <p class="blog-quote-text">There’s a big difference between making a simple product & making a product simple - Des Traynor, Co-Founder of Intercom</p>
                </div>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">UX Challenges faced by Healthcare</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/ux-design-challenges-healthcare.webp" alt="ux design challenges_healthcare" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Bad user experience has infiltrated many areas of healthcare, from hospital administration, Medical Treatment, Online Medical Consultation, and other healthcare processes. The poorly designed user interface was a common denominator driving these inexcusable faults. Even the most experienced nurses were attempting to figure out the monitoring software and missing out on critical information. To better understand the level of frustration that doctors experience with digital systems read <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/why-doctors-hate-their-computers" target="_blank">Atul Gawande’s article Why Doctors Hate Their Computers</a>. This further reinforces the need for User-centric design.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Accessibility & Compliance</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/accessibility-compliance.webp" alt="Accessibility_ Compliance" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Ai-driven solutions make Web-accessible and Health management more necessary. It's difficult to be both accessible and compliant while yet having a unique UI UX Design. One significant constraint of healthcare websites is that users who are blind or visually impaired must be able to access the app or website. To cater to these users, your website and app should be constructed so that they may utilize the tab key on their keyboard to browse all clickable elements. This alone eliminates certain unique features and limits innovation in medical treatment.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Interoperability</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/ux-interoperability.webp" alt="ux_Interoperability" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">It refers to a product's ability to exchange and utilize data. The majority of healthcare management must communicate with other systems. These are intricate interfaces. To make things easier, several standards have been developed. However, the implementation challenges include a significant amount of time, code overruns, and rework.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Making users comfortable with healthcare without complex legacy systems</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/complex-ux-design.webp" alt="complex ux design" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Complicated paperwork and delayed communication have become synonymous with healthcare. For us, the issue is to demonstrate to people that less is more and that this does not have to imply poor Healthcare management.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Desire to be Seen as Safe</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/designing-for-older-people.webp" alt="designing for older people" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">In general, healthcare management wants to be perceived as trustworthy and dependable. As a result, they lack the motivation that a new product provides to push Healthcare UX UI. Some people may be less trusting of these sites or applications if they appear to be too trendy. Similarly, many healthcare companies are accustomed to designing for senior citizens who prefer a more traditional Doctor's Consultation.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Delivering simplified information without morphing the critical data</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Designing better conversational experiences for patients is one solution to this, as it increases the user's interest and perception of the product. The designer's job will be aided by a thorough awareness of the relevant industry, science, and medical, as well as a user-centric design approach.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Refrain from inducing anxiety under any circumstance</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Complex scenarios and task flow. Good UX in healthcare design is easy-to-use, intuitive, and delightful to use products and applications. It is important that the experience one designs should not be complex.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Helping patients help themselves</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/ux-design-diy.webp" alt="ux design_diy" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Traditionally, only qualified medical practitioners have had the right training to interpret the results of different medical scans and tests. With innovations in UI UX Design and Ai driven solutions, we have a greater opportunity than ever to present patients with a medical treatment directly and visualize this in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand. The challenge lies in really understanding what easy and intuitive means to a user, whilst remaining sensitive to the very real anxiety and discomfort that can come with getting online medical consultation.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Clinician-Focused</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Clinicians may need to access healthcare websites or applications from hospital computers, which are often old machines with their own set of limitations. Each of these challenges is difficult enough on its own, but when you combine them, suddenly you realize that problems in healthcare go beyond product managers and marketers.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Multiple application occasions</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">

                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Apps and systems are used in offices, operating rooms, an ambulance, and houses, and the software has to be adjustable to these diverse.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Critical Nature of systems</h4>
                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/ux-challenges-healthcare/critical-nature-of-patients.webp" alt="critical nature of patients" />
                </div>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Healthcare systems have to manage matters of life and death, literally. There are cases of UX design in healthcare apps that literally save lives, and this is a factor that can’t be overlooked.</p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">Neointeraction design team had worked for a healthcare platform that connected cardiologists and patients seamlessly with an <a href="https://www.neointeraction.com/patient-consultation-ux" target="_blank">AI-Driven Healthcare</a> approach. The Consultation Platform thereby predicted timely intervention for Heart failure patients. Considering the criticality of the product, the UX team's solutions for user-centric design made the product considerably simpler to use.</p>
                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Fast pace of healthcare domain development</h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">Healthcare is a very dynamic domain with its brand new practices, treatments, and standards appearing with high regularity. Professionals need to be updated, as does their technology. That brings new tasks for the software engineers.</p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">Cutting-edge sectors like Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality offer huge potential for helping us solve Problems in Healthcare, but we have to be very careful to use and deploy them within the product in a way that truly thrills and adds value to the consumer. The market frequently expects such a product to include these breakthroughs, but our goal is to maintain the customer at the center of everything we do and to only use the power of these new technologies where it helps us create a user-centric design for efficient Health Management.

                <h2 class="blog-body-title">Salient Points</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>User interface and user experience for apps and websites in the healthcare industry must consider disabled people.</li>
                    <li>Apps and websites will have to communicate with other systems based on different technologies, this makes interoperability a challenging task.</li>
                    <li>Healthcare Websites and apps are required to be dependable hence there is resistance to pushing new UI, moreover they cater to people of all ages, so balancing between the old and young people is necessary.</li>
                    <li>Healthcare systems largely depend on legacy applications that are trusted and dependable, hence a new system will take time to earn the trust of users. This leads to slower replacement of old by new technologies.</li>
                </ul>
