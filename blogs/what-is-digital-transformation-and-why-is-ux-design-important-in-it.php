    <p class="blog-body-text">We've been hearing a lot about digital transformation and digital transformation strategy lately, but what exactly is it? Digital transformation definition can be given as the integration of digital technology into all aspects of a business. This process finally raises the fundamental structure of operation in order to add the most value to customer needs. It's also a cultural shift that necessitates firms constantly challenge the status quo, experiment, and become comfortable with failure. According to studies, the global market for digital transformation would increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.5% from $469.8 billion in 2020 to $1,009.8 billion by 2025. (Research & Markets, 2020).</p>
    <p class="blog-body-text">While most traditional companies are striving to remain relevant in the new reality, only some of them understand how to do digital transformation right and what changes it triggers. One of the main mistakes organizations often make is to pay too much attention to technologies while underestimating the role of user experience.</p>
    <p class="blog-body-text">In this article, we’ll explain why focusing on UX design is crucial for receiving positive results from digital transformation.</p>
    <h4 class="blog-body-title">The significance of UX design in digital transformation</h4>
    <div class="blog-banner-img">

    </div>
    <ul class="blog-body-text">
        <li>During digital transformation, your organization has to look at the problem from different perspectives – the perspective of the end-user, the business, and the technology. The intersection where all three perspectives overlap is where UX design resides. The power of leveraging UX design is that as you create a closer alignment between the end-user, the business, and the technology, the circles draw closer together and the impact of UX grows. Digital transformation growth can be seen with the use of UX.</li>
        <li>User experience (UX) covers all phases of the interaction of the users with the company, its products, and services through an enhancement of usability. It’s the method of providing the right, relevant, impactful, and meaningful experiences to the users.</li>
        <li>A company cannot stay afloat if it ignores the requirements of its customers. But that's exactly what some businesses do unintentionally when they go through a digital transformation. They believe that the same tactics that have proven to be effective in real life will also be effective in online encounters. People, on the other hand, act differently in the digital world. As a result, most standard offline communication strategies aren't always effective over the internet.</li>
        <li>A good UX design may handle several issues. It can assist a business in increasing audience engagement, streamlining interactions with each customer, and, eventually, increasing sales. According to statistics, every dollar put into providing a good user experience yields a $100 return. At the same time, 88 percent of online customers say they will not return to a website if the user experience is poor. To put it another way, attaining company objectives while undergoing a digital transformation is impossible unless the entire process is customer centric.</li>
