                    wireframe
                    and selecting the ideal layout and structure came next. Then we designed and prototyped and
                    redesigned and revised again till we reached our final version. The final design was then handed off
                    to the development team.<br />
                    Our website was designed and prototyped using Figma.<br />

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    We chose React Js, Next Js, and Strapi headless CMS frameworks after thoroughly assessing several
                    others for the development of the website.<br />
                    We began by creating a single-page application using the officially approved Create React App tool.
                    The create react app command generates the files required to launch and run the application in a
                    browser. As a result, we can focus on coding the website rather than worrying about the build
                    configurations.<br />
                    We used JSX for markup, CSS for styling, and the <a
                        href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/layout/grid/" target="_blank">bootstrap grid system</a>
                    to implement a grid layout
                    for our website. We added some CSS foundation styles and began constructing the components that can
                    be reused from the design mockup. For instance, the input controls, card components, etc.<br />
                    After which we started building each page and added interactions and slight animations to make the
                    website feel more alive. We used Bootstrap's grid layout to create a responsive website with ease.
                    In addition, we employed rem units for fonts, which aids in adjusting the font size according to the
                    viewport.</br>
                    To make sure the user will have a great experience on any device, we tested each page's
                    responsiveness after it was completed. We used an open-source Strapi headless cms to distribute
                    content consistently across devices. Make sure to hire the best UI UX developers and designers to
                    boost your website.

                    <b>React JS</b>
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    React Js is a free and open-source frontend javascript library. It is based on entities known as
                    components, which render into the required DOM(document object model) element. This makes it an
                    efficient method for creating scalable and quick user interfaces for websites and applications.
                    Since it is built on components, react reduces code redundancy and enhances code reuse, resulting in
                    a much lighter and more manageable codebase. This also facilitates debugging.
                </p>


                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Why we used React js?</b><br />
                <ul>
                    <li>With a component-based architecture, React js seemed a very efficient solution for developing
                        fast & scalable front end for websites.</li>
                    <li>Code reuse - React allows for code reuse, which can really boost productivity.</li>
                    <li>React Js offers fast rendering - React has a feature called virtual DOM in which any new changes
                        are first performed on the virtual DOM which gives higher performance and a cleaner user
                        experience.</li>
                    <li>SEO-friendly - Because of React's fast rendering features, it reduces page load time which in
                        turn benefits the ranking on Google SERP pages.</li>

                    <li>Libraries - React has a strong developer community, and there are many third-party open-source
                        libraries available that we can use in our project.</li>
                </ul>

                    <b>Why we used Next.JS?</b>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Next Js is a react framework that grants additional capabilities like server-side rendering and
                    static site generation to the react application. The server-side rendering feature increases the
                    performance of a Next Js application compared to a regular react application. Applications built
                    with next js tend to get a higher SEO ranking than regular react-based applications.

                    The website's page loading speed and traffic rose thanks to the use of the React, Strapi & Next.js
                    frameworks. The redesigned website is less cluttered and more organized, allowing the projects to
                    stand out.
