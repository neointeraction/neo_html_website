                    <b>Personalized Playlists</b><br/>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Upgrade Prompts</b><br/>
                    Non-intrusive but effective prompts about the benefits of Spotify Premium, such as offline listening and an ad-free experience, are strategically placed to encourage upgrades.

                    <b>Engaging Gamification</b><br/>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>User Psychology</b><br/>
                    Duolingo leans into user psychology to understand what motivates their users. Many users want to learn a language quickly, so Duolingo ensures that their premium service emphasizes features that make users feel like they are advancing faster, such as priority support and faster progress tracking.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>Relevant Paywalls</b><br/>
                    The app uses contextual messaging on the paywalls to make them relevant to the user’s current activity. This approach ensures that the prompts are not jarring and blend seamlessly with the user experience. Additionally, by varying the design of these screens, Duolingo avoids banner blindness, keeping users engaged with the upgrade option.
