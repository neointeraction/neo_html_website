                    The principle of proximity states that we perceive objects which are close to one another as a
                    group. This is true even if the color, size or shape of the objects differ. When people perceive
                    complex objects consisting of many elements, they apply conscious or subconscious methods of
                    arranging the parts into a whole organized system instead of just the set of simple objects. It
                    works on different levels of perception, but the visual part seems to be the most interesting for
                    designers creating interfaces. The simple scheme by Andy Rutledge, given below, visualizes the
                    proximity principle.

                    Proximity is so powerful that it overrides the similarity of patterns, color, shape, and other
                    factors that might differentiate a group of objects.

                    People tend to see elements as related if they are close to each other in comparison to other
                    objects even if other features differ, like another simple scheme below shows

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Many designers use the proximity principles without even knowing or thinking about it. Yet, I would
                    argue, it is always helpful to know why this strategy works. This way you can reason about a design
                    and explain issues to colleagues. And your developer colleague will understand why you need a space
                    of 5px horizontally and 15px vertically between your cards. The <a
                        href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/ui/gestalt-principles-of-design#:~:text=There%20are%20six%20individual%20principles,gestalt%2C%20such%20as%20common%20fate."
                        target="_blank">gestalt principles</a>
                    also make for a
                    great checklist when something feels off about a design. </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    The importance of proximity in making a text easy to read cannot be overstated. A title, for
                    example, requires more white space before and after it. It feels more connected to the portion it
                    belongs to since it is closer to it. Another example is line height. The line spacing (i.e, space
                    between lines) must be larger than the space between words, but not so large that they do not
                    constitute a paragraph. The same can be said about letter spacing. The spacing must be large enough
                    to discern letters yet tiny enough to allow words to be formed from the individual letters.

                    Let's take an example of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" target="_blank">Britannica
                        Website</a>

                    The image below shows two lists of the same items. On the left, it’s difficult to wade through all
                    the items as they are equally close together, while on the right you see instantly that certain
                    items fit together logically. Create more logical groupings and put white space between the items
                    that shouldn’t be grouped together.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Today’s websites are full of content, making grouping the items all the more important.

                    We can take advantage of this principle by grouping similar information, such as sections within the
                    same page/ web app or navigation buttons. Being so close, the white space plays a fundamental role
                    to let the eyes get some rest.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    White space is a powerful tool for establishing proximity. Adding white space to the same group
                    helps us interpret things differently. Use white space to reinforce groupings and distinguish them
                    from other UI components in your designs.

                    <b>For example:</b> On the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>
                    website we can see the proximity principle applied. Certain
                    products are grouped together according to the categories for faster interaction between the user
                    and the website. The white space is used between each category to get a better understanding and to
                    differentiate between Rewards, offers & top picks, etc... By adding white space between UI
                    components, we change the perception of the groupings.

                    Taking the amazon example further you can see how a similar product ( i.e Mouse) forms a group
                    related by its proximity as well as depending on the previous browsing history you can also see all
                    the items (i.e books) grouped together by their proximity.

                    <b>Menus & Lists</b>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Many app menus have huge gaps between the icons and the labels. This adds mental complexity to your
                    design as the user needs to organize the interface in their head. Take care to get your proximities
                    right and the interface will be much easier to understand.

                    Every app has some sort of list screen, therefore knowing how to improve them is quite useful. The
                    purpose of list design is to make individual items easily identifiable. Instead of using lines
                    between things, you can use proximity to reduce visual noise. Just make sure there's more space
                    between items than between the components that make up an item.

                    Dashboards often show stats, be it your sports activities or car usage. When adding a label above or
