                    Teams create prototypes with varying degrees of detail in order to capture design thoughts and test

                    By creating low-fidelity prototypes early in the UI UX design phase, you are trying to represent

                    Low-fidelity prototypes can show a lot of the functionality of a product, but not all the details

                    Paper prototyping is a method of developing ideas and designing user flows using hand-sketched
                    “screens” that represent a digital product. It can be helpful during the early-stage conceptualizing
                    — when a team needs to explore a variety of concepts and choose the one that will be right. Paper
                    prototypes allow quick visualization and are low-fidelity because they don’t have any functionality.

                    In comparison to low-fidelity prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes delve into a lot more detail that
                    consists of functionality and interactivity. They are as close as you can get to the final product.
                    The hi-fi prototypes cover not only the user interface (UI) of the product in terms of visuals and
                    aesthetics but also the user experience (UX) aspects in terms of interactions, user flow, and
                    behavior. High-fidelity prototypes are typically better by creating them later in the design phase.
                    They’re better for user testing, as well as for getting a team’s final sign-off on a product UI UX
                    design before development begins.

                    An animated prototype is an invaluable tool used by designers to create a rough run-through of an
                    app or interface that shows the transitions and motion of a design. While some mockups can convey
                    the overall style of a user interface, an animated prototype offers an active simulation.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Animations are advantageous for UI UX developers because you can look at your prototypes as one of
                    your best tools of communication. By prototyping animations, and sharing them with your UI UX
                    developers, they will be able to see exactly how you imagined the product. The same can be said for
                    any stakeholders. They’ll be able to see moveable screens even when there is no existing product.
                    You don’t have to write thousands of papers filled with detailed instructions about the features and
                    movements of the animations.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Animations can be helpful from a UX point of view. But they have to be tested and used accordingly

                    Prototyping at the wrong fidelity is one of the top prototyping mistakes. Unfortunately, there isn’t

                    fidelity of the prototype you should develop ultimately depends on project circumstances and the
                    preferences of the UX designer. If your project's goal is to provide a quality user experience,
                    prototyping must be a component of the UI UX <a

                    to select the most effective prototyping process - one that minimizes work while increasing
