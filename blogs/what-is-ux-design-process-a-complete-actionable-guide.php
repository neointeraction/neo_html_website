                    What is a Design Process?
                </h4>

                Let’s understand what a ‘Design Process’ is in the simplest of terms.

                “A design process is a method of breaking down a complex project into smaller, more manageable parts. This process is used by architects, engineers, physicists, and
                other designers to solve complex problems”

                Now that we understand what the design process means, let’s dive a little deeper. One of the most important things to remember as a good ui ux designer is that
                every process could vary based on the problem that you’re trying to solve. One approach may not always help you in reaching your goals. Each project will have its
                different share of problems and goals which you will have to define and act accordingly. But don’t worry, the steps in ux design process are usually very flexible
                and you always have the freedom to improvise.

                The image below shows a basic framework of ux design process, which you can refer to and develop your own process with the help of it.

                    Why a Design Process is needed?

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    And now that we have a better understanding of the Design Process, we will see why the UX design process is so important in every type of project.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Having a UX design process allows us to be more efficient and effective when we are trying to solve a problem. Since there is a plan laid out for us that has
                    been researched and well thought of, we can make decisions faster and move forward without taking a lot of risks. And sometimes, when we follow a detailed
                    process, it helps us find solutions to problems that we might not even realize.

                    users.

                    now forced
                    to think differently and explore other areas which help in developing new innovative ideas.
