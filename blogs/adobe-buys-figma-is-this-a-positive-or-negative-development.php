                    On Thursday, 15th Sep 2022, An ivy league college dropout suddenly became the most-talked-about person in the technology world. His design product company, small-but-fast growing Figma, agreed to be sold to rival <a href="https://www.adobe.com/in/" target="_blank">Adobe Inc.</a> for $20 Billion in cash and stocks.

                    <a href="https://www.figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a> is cloud-based collaboration software that eventually got popular among Designers, Software developers, and Product Managers who design and develop apps and other technology products.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Figma was founded by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace when still at Brown university studying computer science and decided to start an app designing company together. Big investors like Index Ventures, Greylock Partners, and Phoenix Court were the early backers of Figma.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Figma is not just a design tool but a center of design resources, tools, plugins, and guides. Even if you use software like Sketch, Adobe XD, or any other alternative platform, there are high chances that Figma might still be a part of your design process.

                    <p class="blog-quote-text">Adobe’s greatness has been rooted in our ability to create new categories and deliver cutting-edge technologies through organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions - Shantanu Narayen CEO, Adobe</p>
                </div>



                <h4 class="blog-body-title">
                    Why UI UX designers are uncomfortable with this takeover?
                </h4>
                

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Without a doubt, this news caused some controversy in the creative world because creatives are worried about what might become of Figma post this deal. Figma is a design tool frequently used by UI Ux designers for their <a href="https://www.neointeraction.com/project" target="_blank">projects</a>.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Adobe is behind well-known design tools like Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Acrobat Reader Dc, and Adobe Premiere Pro but wasn't able to keep up with the most feature-rich, industry-standard software and programs in the creative business.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Adobe has had a considerable number of mergers and acquisitions even before its acquisition of Figma. Adobe has stated that it will keep Figma going, but Figma users are mainly concerned that Adobe, a monopolistic giant, will charge them more money. Figma design system currently offers a free starting plan and a professional plan that costs $12 per month per editor, which is significantly less than an Adobe Creative Cloud single-app subscription. However, as mentioned before, there are no plans to change its pricing, and access for those in education will remain the same.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Dylan Field, the CEO, and co-founder of Figma has disclosed details about the agreement, including the fact that he will continue in his role but will now answer to David Wadhwani, the president of Adobe's Digital Media Business.
                </p>


                <h4 class="blog-body-title">
                    Is Adobe's acquisition of Figma such a cause for concern?
                </h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    It took Figma founders four years to launch the first public version of the software for designers, but Adobe's vast resources could help develop the platform and promote it to more users further.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Today, the digital age runs majorly on Adobe’s design tools and platforms, and the UI UX design services of the company have touched billions across the globe.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Both product designing companies share a passion for assisting individuals and businesses to be creative and productive. They could have an opportunity to power the future of work by fusing the capabilities for collaboration, creativity, and brainstorming. Adobe tools like <a href="https://www.neointeraction.com/post/6-big-reasons-to-apply-illustrations-in-ui-ux-design"  target="_blank">Illustrator are vital in UI UX design</a> and can be used in conjunction with figma to create stunning projects.
