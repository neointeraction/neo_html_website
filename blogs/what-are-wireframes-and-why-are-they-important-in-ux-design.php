                Wireframes are a major part of the UI UX workflow and are used to communicate ideas regarding screen layouts, similar to an architectural blueprint, a wireframe is a two-dimensional skeletal outline of a web page or app. For example, Wireframing can range from simple hand-drawn sketches on paper to more sophisticated digital and interactive prototypes that show the desired end product. They are black-and-white layouts that define the size and placement of user interface elements on a screen. They also give information on usability, functionality, area conversion, and navigation. Colors, typefaces, logos, and other design elements are not used in wireframe designs to maintain the focus on the structure.

                At this level, it is much easier to identify the project's flaws, problems, usability, and redundant functionality. You might want to add something new to improve the product or perhaps completely modify its logic. All of these adjustments are simple to handle during wireframe designs. Any changes you make at this point have no effect on the team's workflow. However, it is not so simple at the design stage as every change will require more time and, thus, more money for <a href="https://www.neointeraction.com/ui-ux-design-services" target="_blank">UI UX design services</a>.

                    UX Audit is a necessary aspect of the design process in order to create a solution that meets both business and user requirements. If we focus on the details of the product and services, we tend to overlook the users and their perspectives. UX strategy and research play an important role in the process of product design. The most important factor of this project was that users might easily be lost due to a bad online presence experience.
