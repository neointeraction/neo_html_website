                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>a) Design Ideation</b><br />
                    During brainstorming sessions, refer to the user personas to align design concepts with the diverse
                    needs and goals of different user segments. User personas serve as valuable reminders of the target

                    Utilize insights from user personas to guide wireframing and prototyping. Design interfaces that
