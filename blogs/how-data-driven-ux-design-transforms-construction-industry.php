                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Fragmented procedures, reliance on paper, and reactive problem-solving in the construction industry result in delays, increased costs, and safety concerns.According to a study by McKinsey, large construction projects typically take 20% longer to finish than scheduled and are up to 80% over budget. Conventional techniques are not effective, as they depend on manpower and continuous monitoring. On the other hand, for example, Turner Construction reduced safety incidents by 30% through real-time data monitoring and predictive analytics. Data-driven methodologies utilize technology and statistics to streamline operations, enhance communication, and safety through innovation.
