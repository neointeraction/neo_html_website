                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Web development teams are constantly seeking ways to improve user experience, streamline development
                    processes, and boost overall efficiency. Neointeraction Front end development team has been working
                    extensively on implementing Micro Frontend Architecture (MFA) across various client projects. To
                    delve into this topic & share our team's practical experience, Neointeraction Design organized a
                    workshop on "Micro Frontend Architecture Driving User Experience" conceptualized by our UI lead
                    Shameer M, & facilitated by our frontend engineering team Eldhos Aji(UI/Web Developer), Midhun
                    M(Project Lead).

                    What is Micro Frontend Architecture?
                </h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Micro Frontend Architecture involves breaking down monolithic frontend applications into smaller,
                    independently deployable, and manageable units called micro frontends. These micro frontends can be
                    developed, tested, and deployed separately, allowing teams to work autonomously on specific features
                    or modules. With this approach applications developed using different frontend technologies can be
                    brought under one single view without the users knowing that each of them are different application.
                </p>

                    Benefits Micro Frontend Architecture (MFA)
                </h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    MFA offers several advantages in web development, including modularity and flexibility, which are
                    crucial for UI Development teams. This modularity leads to rapid iterations and updates without
                    affecting the entire system. Additionally, MFA supports scalability by effortlessly adding or
                    removing micro frontends based on requirements, benefiting UI UX developers and UX UI design teams.
                    This approach also enhances maintainability by simplifying maintenance tasks and reducing the risk
                    of system-wide failures.

                    Comparing monolithic and MFA architectures

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    While monolithic apps can become challenging to scale as they grow, MFA allows for granular
                    scalability, making it easier to manage larger applications. Moreover, MFA improves maintainability
                    by isolating changes to specific micro frontends, minimizing disruptions compared to monolithic
                    systems. Lastly, MFA promotes flexibility and continuous delivery, enhancing agility in web
                    development processes.

                        target="_blank">real-life case study</a> was presented,
                    demonstrating the implementation of MFA in a large-scale enterprise web application. The case study
                    showcased the challenges encountered while managing a monolithic frontend and how transitioning to
                    MFA effectively addressed these challenges. It highlighted the benefits of MFA in improving
                    scalability, autonomy, and maintainability in a real-world scenario. A hands-on task was curated for
                    the workshop to give a practical experience in Micro Frontend Architecture (MFA) using React.js,
                    Angular & Vue.Js frameworks.
