                    The banking sector in the past decade has seen a drastic change in its structure and the way it
                    works. With the integration of technology, the banking sector has seen immense growth in terms of
                    processing information, customer experience, and overall faster communication with customers. Be it

                    lengthy forms and transferring money is smoother than ever.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    This success of the banking sector has led financial corporations to develop new digital products
                    that help make the most out of the customer’s money. With numerous benefits, big corporations and
                    businesses are focusing more on Fintech products due to their ease of use and scalability. It’s no
                    wonder why so many financial mobile apps and websites have become a huge trend over the past few
                    years. And the success of these products depends on a good customer experience which eventually

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">
                    Why do most Fintech rely heavily on a design thinking process?
                </h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Since Fintech services can be considered digital products, they always need a certain amount of
                    visual appeal. From the look and feel of the application screens to the way how it is developed,
                    everything matters. And since these products are financial-based, there’s a lot of trust-building
                    with users as they will be spending their time and most importantly money on these apps.

                    Fintech apps revolve around a customer-centric design thinking process for some of these following
                    reasons below,
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>1. To build a user-centric business</b><br />
                    Relying on just good UI design is merely not enough to have a strong user base for your product. The
                    key is to always have the customer as the focus so the app is built around them and not the other
                    way around.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>2. To Innovate and Adapt to situations</b><br />
                    Fintech apps require them to have a flexible and adaptive process of product design that helps them
                    develop new innovative ideas or features. And these new concepts will only come from doing actual
                    research on customers and users.<br />Now, due to the covid situation, there is a huge disruption in
                    businesses and their customers. So, a process revolving around the circumstances of the users is
                    always beneficial. And a well-structured design thinking process will surely do the job.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>3. To be different from a <a href="<?php echo $path; ?>internet-banking-ux"
                            target="_blank">Banking Solution</a></b><br />
                    A Fintech app is very different from it’s counterparts, i.e; banking solutions. Both play around in
                    the digital space but Fintech packs a punch with it’s new and fresh ideas.<br />A banking solution
                    with good UI UX design will do great because most users are alike and they all want the same thing,
                    access banking services. On the other hand, a Fintech app needs good UI UX design plus delivers new
                    expectations of users because the types of users here are very unique and vast. And only with a
                    customer-centric approach can Fintech succeed.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>4. To connect with it’s users</b><br />
                    Without the support of users, Fintech will certainly fade away in this competitive market. So, the
                    moment a user starts using the app, it needs to connect to the user and build a trustworthy
                    relationship. And this can be done by studying and understanding what the users want.

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">What will good design do for a Fintech?</h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    A good amount of investment in a design process will ensure that the product is going to deliver the
                    needs of the users. And when it is done right, developing a connection with the users becomes a lot
                    easier. Gaining their trust, generating credibility, and showing a transparent process are all
                    important parts of building a successful Fintech product.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    But above all, it is also important for a Fintech to be profitable. And this can be achieved by
                    having a strong design process that acts as the foundation of Fintech’s business model. A flow with
                    which a user will navigate through the application, explore services and invest money in the product
                    is crucial and requires planning. And a good design process can help achieve this feat by doing the
                    following,
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>1. A simplified user journey</b><br />
                    To make the app interactive, it needs to have a simple layout, content, and flow. The user should
                    feel motivated to use the app as suggested by B.J. Fogg’s Behavior Model.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Now, in order to accomplish this, it is crucial to understand the basic knowledge of the target user
                    base and how a problem they may be facing can be solved. Giving simple tips or CTA buttons and
                    showing the appropriate information they need develops a good user experience. This practice will
                    enable the user to trust the app with their finances.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>2. Showing only the essentials</b><br />
                    Information overload can be a troublesome user experience for most. Showing users long texts with
                    unfamiliar words will only create more confusion. So, it’s always better to understand and think
                    about the people who will use the app. With this approach, unnecessary data can be hidden and the
                    user can focus and analyze the important information presented on the screen.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>3. Displaying Data Visually</b><br />
                    All finance apps will have to deal with a lot of data and information. Asking a user to read or go
                    through every other number on the screen will be very excruciating. Instead, graphical informative
                    elements like charts or graphs with standardized color schemes must be used. This eases the
                    translation of complex data into simpler digestive bits.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>4. A good user interface</b><br />
                    Most users will be attracted to the app by the way it looks and feels. The first visual impression
                    matters. Design elements like colors, typography, visual imagery, graphics, micro-interaction, etc
                    carry a lot of weightage in delivering the first impression. And without this, a user may not enjoy
                    using the app and simply jump over to another app.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>5. A custom experience</b><br />
                    As we know, users on any Fintech app are not the same. They will come from a vast variety of
                    backgrounds and knowledge. For users like these, customizable features and services would be a great
                    way to deliver a good experience. Things like converting data of currencies to Dollars ($) to INR
                    (Indian Rupees), an option of language change based on the user’s location, use of familiar slang or
                    words based on the user’s regional area, and much more.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    With plenty of experience in the financial domain, we at Neointeraction have worked with developing
                    multiple <a href="<?php echo $path; ?>share-trading-platform-redesign"
                        target="_blank">Fintech applications</a> over the years. Our biggest
                    strength is our thorough and detailed
                    design process which has been the formula of success for us for the past 12+ years. The design team
                    at Neointeraction focuses greatly on understanding the business model and the user requirements of
                    the Fintech app. By developing a well-thought flow that keeps the user and their expectations on
                    focus, we are able to give the product the direction it needs.

                    We always strive to deliver a great experience for users and this is how we do it,
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>1. Conduct User Research</b><br />
                    Every design process starts with collecting data. While developing a Fintech app, it is very
                    important to understand the business model and the users. Based on this knowledge, designers can
                    create flows and designs that feel familiar to that particular userbase. And when done right, it can
                    deliver the needs of users giving them a satisfying experience.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>2. Build Quick Wireframes and Prototypes</b><br />
                    Whenever a new Fintech product idea is pitched, it is very important to check it’s feasibility and
                    usability. And the fastest way to ensure this is by building wireframes or prototypes. This process
                    will show if your product has any underlying issues that you may have not thought of before. And a
                    streamlined design process will take care of that for you.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>3. Get Early Feedback</b><br />
                    Building up from the previous point, the wireframes or prototypes that get developed can be shared
                    with a select number of your users. And with their feedbacks, whether good or bad, you will now know
                    what is working well and what’s not. With these inputs, the design can be modified and made better
                    before you launch the new Fintech idea to the market.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>4. Helps Reduce Costs</b><br />
                    Now imagine a scenario where you launch a product without a design process. You have no data about
                    the users or what they want. And eventually down the road, your users will have a bad experience and
                    turn their backs on the product. What do you do know, restart the whole process? And what would it
                    cost to start it all again?

                    That’s one big reason to invest in UX. Starting the process with a planned approach will always help
                    your business stay on a safer side whenever you’re planning to launch a new product or service.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <b>5. Positive word of mouth and brand loyalty</b><br />
                    With good customer service, you’re not only making your customers happy but also bringing in new
                    ones. Positive word of mouth can help boost your Fintech app to the next level and if you can use
                    Social Media here the right way, your product will get strong validation from a lot of potential
                    customers. And continuing to deliver this positive experience will eventually result in some loyal
                    userbase who will always have your back.
