                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    PWA (Progressive Web Apps) continues to gain traction due to their ability to offer a native app-like experience within a web browser. It runs on a browser but gives us the property to put an app icon, app name, splash screen, push notifications, and many native configurations. PWAs are highly responsive, work offline with service workers, and provide faster load times, making them an attractive option for businesses looking to improve user engagement and accessibility. It has relatively less size compared to a traditional application, it hardly has a size of 1-2 MB, so it is also size efficient.

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">
                    1.3 Component driven development
                </h4>

                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/top-frontend-trends/component-driven-frontend-development.webp" alt="Component driven frontend development" />

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Component Driven Development is revolutionizing how web applications are developed, promoting modularity, reusability, and scalability. This methodology centers around breaking down the user interface into independent, self-contained components, each with its own functionality and style. Frameworks like React leverage this component-driven approach well, and it’s one of the reasons why React is the most popular framework to use in any project.

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Benefits of component driven development:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Modularity and Reusability: </b>
                            Components are designed as self-contained units that contain their logic and styles. This modularity allows developers to reuse components across different parts of an application or even in different projects, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability and consistency.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Improved Collaboration: </b>
                            Different teams can work on separate components simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work. This parallel development speeds up the overall development process.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Isolated Testing and Easier Maintenance: </b>
                            Since components are independent units, they can be tested in isolation, leading to more easy and reliable testing. This isolation helps identify and fix bugs more efficiently. Also, maintaining and updating the application becomes more straightforward. Developers can make changes to individual components without affecting the entire system.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Scalability and Flexibility: </b>
                            As the application grows, new components can be added without disrupting existing functionality. Components can be easily adapted or replaced to meet changing requirements, making the application more flexible and resilient to change.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    1.4 WebAssembly(WASM)
                </h4>

                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/top-frontend-trends/features-of-web-assembly.webp" alt=" Features of Web assembly" />

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format designed for efficient execution and compact representation. It allows code written in various languages, such as C, C++, and Rust, to run on the web at near-native speed. This powerful technology is transforming web development by enabling high-performance applications and opening up new possibilities for web-based software.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Key features of WASM are:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Near-Native Speed: </b>
                            WebAssembly is designed to execute at near-native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities available on modern devices. This makes it possible to run computationally intensive applications, such as games, simulations, and data analysis tools, directly in the browser.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Optimized Compilation: </b>
                            Code compiled to WASM is optimized for fast loading and execution, reducing latency and improving user experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Universal Execution: </b>
                            WASM is supported by all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, ensuring that applications run consistently across different platforms and devices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Language Agnosticism: </b>
                            Developers can write code in their preferred programming languages and compile it to WASM, allowing for greater flexibility and leveraging existing codebases.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Controlled Execution: </b>
                            WASM code is executed with limited access to the system, minimizing the potential for harmful actions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Sandboxed Environment: </b>
                            WebAssembly runs in a secure, sandboxed environment, which helps protect the host system from potentially malicious code. This isolation provides a strong security model, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

                    1.5 Rendering Methods
                </h4>

                <div class="blog-banner-img">
                    <img src="<?php echo $path; ?>assets/images/blog/top-frontend-trends/rendering-methods-in-frontend-development.webp" alt="Rendering Methods in Frontend development" />
                </div>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    We have different types of frontend rendering methods available which we can leverage according to our needs. These days web frameworks like Next.JS have become more advanced to give us multiple rendering methods. These formats cater to different needs and use cases, providing developers with flexibility in how they build and deploy their applications.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Here are the main rendering formats which you can leverage according to your requirements:
                </p>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>GStatic Site Generation (SSG): </b>
                            SSG means we generate static pages that don't change often which generates HTML at build time. This approach is ideal for pages that can be pre-rendered ahead of a user’s request, such as blogs, documentation, and marketing pages.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Server-Side Rendering (SSR): </b>
                            SSR generates HTML on each request. This is suitable for pages that require real-time data or personalized content giving you the benefits of SEO as the content is rendered on the server first.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Client-Side Rendering (CSR): </b>
                            CSR involves fetching and rendering data entirely on the client side after the initial page load. This method can be used for user-specific data that doesn’t need to be pre-rendered or for parts of the app that change frequently and don’t need to be indexed by search engines.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): </b>
                            ISR is a new concept that allows you to use static generation on a per-page basis but with the ability to update static content after the site has been built and deployed. ISR combines the benefits of static generation and server-side rendering. You can set a revalidation period to regenerate the static page in the background at a specified interval.
