                    Colors can influence how we feel. There are times when we associate a product with a color. A product's perception by humans is significantly influenced by color.

                    An instance of this is the use of the color blue. Blue is the most popular color used in brands. It gives off a calm and comfortable feeling to the users. When IBM redesigned its logo in 1972, the color blue represented power, authority, and professionalism. It exemplifies their sense of professionalism.

                    Color can't be generally associated with any specific set of emotions since it depends too much on individual experiences. According to research, personal tastes, experiences, upbringings, cultural variations, and environment, all muddle the effect that individual colors have on us.

                    Different colors invoke different emotions in people and these emotions are leveraged by designers when creating a product. The color psychology behind three primary colors used by most famous brands around the world are:

                    How to choose color based on your product?

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Consumers give greater consideration to how well a color matches a product than to the color itself. It is important to select colors that reflect the company's identity while picking the color palette. Researching the typical color preferences of your competitors is also crucial. Designers must also pay attention to the usability and accessibility of the color. Thoughtful color choices can not only attract users to the product but also help distinguish them from its competitors.

                    The choice of colors for a corporation should effectively communicate its message. It is critical to determine whether it serves a specific purpose or idea. The target demographic must be identified to select the color that is best for a firm. There are occasions when firms decide on a color that does not accurately represent their image and pursue rebranding. This can be observed in the <a href="https://www.thebrandingjournal.com/2014/07/airbnbs-consistent-rebrand-focuses-sense-belonging-community/" target="_blank">rebranding of Airbnb</a>. The Airbnb logo was rebranded from blue to its current-signature red. This was done because the firm believed that the color blue might give users a cold or corporate impression. As a result, a vibrant red was chosen to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. This proved to be a success, and the rebranding aided the platform's growth.

                    There are also times when companies would go with an unlikely color to make their product stand out. Subway is one such example. While a majority of the food industry uses the color red for its logo, Subway went against the norm and opted for a refreshing yellow and green color palette. This helped them stand out from their rivals.

                    However, this method can also backfire. This is seen in the 1992 launch of Coca-Cola's clear cola beverage. Although the soft drink tasted like regular Coca-Cola, most consumers were put off by the concept of drinking clear cola.

                    According to studies, the color of a product influences a consumer's decision to buy it by 60 to 80 percent. Color has the uncanny potential to make or break a product's success. It is critical to select a well-thought-out color palette.

                <h4 class="blog-body-title">Takeaway</h4>

                <p class="blog-body-text">
                    Despite the complexity of color theory, learning the fundamentals isn't very difficult. Designers can then expand their skills to produce more intricate and diverse color palettes for their designs. Select colors that convey your brand's values or the emotions you want clients to experience when exploring your online store.
